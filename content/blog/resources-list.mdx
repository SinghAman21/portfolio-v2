## Introduction

As mentioned in my previous post, this year I'm planning to learn the things I couldn't focus on in 2024 — for reasons I've already shared. In this post, I'm listing down the topics I plan to learn and the resources I'll use. Hopefully, this helps anyone else looking to study similar topics too.

## List of Topics, Reasons for Learning, and Resource Links

| Topic Name | Reason for Learning | Resource Link |
|------------|---------------------|----------------|
| **Spring Boot** | I've always known Java and used it for DSA, but now I want to deep dive into the backend framework. | [Lovepreet Singh Bhaiya](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CBVLpg0zqf_ggig9cOr72oZNGf9RZmZ&si=NLHshmGmWfDiEAug) |
| **NestJS** | It's trending due to its support for microservices and allows using JavaScript as a backend language. | [Dave Gray](https://youtu.be/8_X0nSrzrCw) |
| **Kubernetes** | I wanted to learn it in 2024, but now in 2025 I plan to use it to deploy apps in production and keep my projects running smoothly. | [Tech Tutorial with Piyush](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl4APkPHzsUUOkOv3i62UidrLmSB8DcGC&si=HdwJOg1nsTUReR8b) |
| **RAG-based Applications (LangChain)** | It's popular right now, especially with AI-powered apps. I want to understand the core concepts and build something simple. | [FreeCodeCamp #1](https://youtu.be/sVcwVQRHIc8), [FreeCodeCamp #2](https://youtu.be/HSZ_uaif57o), [Harish Neel](https://youtu.be/at6XrRRdOQo) |
| **iOS App Development** | Always wanted to explore app development, especially on iOS. | [Udemy Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/deep-dive-ios-16-swiftui-programming/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING), [Udemy - Kenneth Jones](https://www.udemy.com/course/ios-15-app-development-with-swiftui-3-and-swift-5/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING) |



## Plan to Complete

1. **Start with NestJS** — Complete it and build one project to solidify understanding for future use.
2. **Move to RAG** — Focus on grasping the underlying concepts and build a simple app using them.
3. **Continue with Kubernetes** — But with a twist: I'll be using [Podman](https://podman.io/) alongside the tutorial.
4. **Then: Spring Boot or iOS App Dev** — Depending on how things go and what interests me at the time.

Meanwhile, in free time:
- I'll be following [Applied OS](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7CBVLpg0zqfIdcwDNa5c2xbhvK4crNqc&si=Oq7HUaF-hGWHx7fK)
- Studying for higher studies entrance exams
- Working on personal projects or attending **Team Siksha's sessions**

I'll be **starting after 17th February**, once semester exams are over.

Also, I plan to write articles on these topics as I learn — both as notes for myself and to help others revisiting the same.
